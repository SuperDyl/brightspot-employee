# RelEdProfessors

Simple database library for pulling data from a BrightSpot website.
Default setup can pull professor data from https://religion.byu.edu/directory,
though the Professor and Professor_Processor classes can be overriden
to allow scraping data for most websites.
The library also supports using csv files.
